This [clock](http://imgur.com/gallery/ViJSp) is awesome. I made it in javascript.

Also, the intervals are editable. That is, if you really wanted to, you could just add an interval for each number up to 30. Or cut some out (but not minutes or o'clock, cause they're special).

Or slap in some more. Say, 17 minutes. Just because.
